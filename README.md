## ðŸš€ Features

- **Immersive OS Boot Simulation**  
  Experience a realistic emulation of an OS boot sequence with firmware initialization, bootloader loading, kernel booting, and more.

- **Interactive Binary Operations**  
  Input binary values and choose from a range of logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XNOR) to see real-time results.

- **Detailed Progress Tracking**  
  Enjoy a visual progress bar that updates as each simulation stage is executed, providing clear insights into the system's status.

- **ANSI Color-Coded Output**  
  Each step of the simulation is enhanced with color-coded terminal messages for improved readability and engagement.

- **Robust Logging and Error Handling**  
  Comprehensive logging ensures that every operation and error is recorded with timestamps, aiding in troubleshooting and learning.

- **Adaptive Delays for Realism**  
  Configurable delays mimic real-time processing, enhancing the authenticity of the boot sequence (use `--speed=<value>` to adjust).
